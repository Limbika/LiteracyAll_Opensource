PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The Project contains an editor and a player. The user must create a user in the app for creating task packs.
Each task pack can have a lot of tasks inside of it. The tasks are created in the editor. The editor has a vast number of
options and can create slides. These slides include sounds, images, texts & different animations etc. After creating the tasks
a user can play it with the player. It can be very useful for the teachers who want to create special tasks for children and want
the children learn through images and words. The rich digital contents are very much helpful for a child's mental development.
